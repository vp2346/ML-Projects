## Matrix Factorization for Movie Recommendation

This project is using Matrix Factorization model for movie recommendation. 

## Dataset
The data set consists of: 100,000 ratings (1-5) from 943 users on 1682 movies. Each user has rated at least 20 movies. 
       
ratings.csv contains the ratings data in the format: user_id, movie_id, rating

ratings_test.csv contains the test set with ground truth in the same format as ratings.txt.

movies.txt contains the mapping from movie_id to movie name. Row j corresponds to index j of movie_id.

## Matrix Factorization Algorithm
Matrix_factorization.m: For the algorithm, we set σ2 = 0.25, d = 10 and λ = 1. Train the model on the larger training
set for 100 iterations. For each user-movie pair in the test set, predict the rating using the relevant dot product.

It outputs a) and b) below.

a) Log joint likelihood for iterations 2 to 100 for 10 runs:
